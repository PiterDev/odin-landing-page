# Odin Landing Page

This is a website for my made-up AmogOS Hyprland project I created as part of the Odin Project curriculum.

## FAQ

#### Please release this OS, I need it

I know everyone want to have AmogOS hyprland on their computers, but sadly it's not real. You can try [AmogOS](https://github.com/Amog-OS/AmogOS).

#### Where's the wallpaper from?

The wallpaper and AmogOS logo was downloaded from [this repo](https://github.com/Amog-OS/AmogOS-Wallpapers). The original art and icon were made by peekatchoo.
